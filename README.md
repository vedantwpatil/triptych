# Triptych

Combination of multiple productivity apps into one specialized for my personal command line use case

### Future Plans

- [ ] Create a schedule in which everything is either 30 minute or 15 minute blocks. This will be loaded in from a json file using serde
- [ ] You can quickly add tasks to the next block (add "prepare for cs 281 (class name) final" and this would be added to the next academic block)
  - [ ] Should also be able to add tasks for different classes to be able to list homework
- [ ] You can also easily add daily tasks that show up on a all day calendar
